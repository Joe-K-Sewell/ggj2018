// Bad Ending: 
// (phone perspective)

L, m: Your brother made it clear that he doesn’t want me here right now. I’m going to take the job and after a few months there we can see where everything’s at.
R, p: He’ll come around. I know he just doesn’t understand yet. 
L, m: Maybe.. I’m sorry you can’t go back to school this semester. If only he had gotten his grades up...
R, p: I wish he had made it into my school, but I don’t mind taking a year off for family. It isn’t like I have much choice. I’ll get a job at home and work on paying off some of my student loans. 
L, m: Thank you, I know it will be worth it. Then I guess we’ll see where it goes from there, if Ash wants to talk to me.
R, p: He will, I’m sure of it.
L, m: My flight is taking off soon, so I’m going to have to say goodbye. Give my love to Ash.
R, p: Stay safe. Love you.
L, m: I love you too Parker.
