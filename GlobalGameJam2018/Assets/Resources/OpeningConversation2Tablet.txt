R, a: Hey nerd. Is the wifi working for you?
L, p: Yeah it’s fine. Why? 
R, a: my tablet keeps glitching… please tell me you didn’t mess with it again
L, p: Of course I didn’t mess with it, that was a one-time thing to see if I could. Mom’s gonna kill you if you broke your tablet.
R, a: i didn’t. Idk what’s going on but it’s better now. If you did do something I’m gonna kick your butt. 
L, p: Yeah right. You couldn’t kick my butt even if you could reach, shorty. 
R, a: ...
R, a: what if it’s a hacker
L, p: What do you mean? 
R, a: messing with my tablet. It could be a hacker. 
R, a: or a ghost even
L, p: Don’t be ridiculous. Besides if it was a ghost they would kick your butt too.
R, a: Suuure. 
R, a: I’m gonna name them Charlie. 
L, p: Mom’s home.
R, a: I know.
L, p: You should go talk to her. I don’t think she meant to hurt you. 
R, a: I don’t want to. 
L, p: I think she’s trying, Ash. it’s hard.
R, a: I said no.
