// Second Tablet convo:
// (Tablet Template 2 - Ash to Parker)

R, a: what’s been going on with you and mom lately?
L, p: I’ve been helping her prepare for her new job, if that’s what you mean. 
R, a: What are we going to do when she’s gone? Sure you’re technically an adult, but we don’t even know how long she will be gone. 
L, p: I wish we had talked about this before she went looking for the job. There has to be some other way.
